      <description>Every time I tell people that my major is computational biology–I’m met with blank stares and even I, myself, don’t know the best way to answer such a question. I usually say something like “ah just think about bio but with math and computer applications”. So, I think for my first post, it is most appropriate to actually -show- everyone some of what compuational biologists do.
About In SDS348, or “Computational Biology and Bioinformatics”, we dove into topics of: Data visualization, Probability functions, Manipulation/Wrangling, Matrices, Distances, Associations, Clustering, PCA, Hypothesis Testing, Simulation, ANOVA, MANOVA, PERMANOVA, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Binary Classification, Cross Validation and Regularization.</description>
