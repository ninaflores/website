      <description>Every time I tell people that my major is computational biology–I’m met with blank stares and even I, myself, don’t know the best way to answer such a question. I usually say something like “ah just think about bio but with math and computer applications”. So, I think for my first post, it is most appropriate to actually -show- everyone some of what compuational biologists do.
About In SDS348, or “Computational Biology and Bioinformatics”, we dove into topics of: Data visualization, Probability functions, Manipulation/Wrangling, Matrices, Distances, Associations, Clustering, PCA, Hypothesis Testing, Simulation, ANOVA, MANOVA, PERMANOVA, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Binary Classification, Cross Validation and Regularization.</description>

      <description>I obtained two datasets containing information about recent movies. As an avid movie goer, who is a proud AMC A-list member and an alumni of Moviepass (may it rest in peace), I was interested in seeing the relationships between various movie production companies, actors, budgets, genres, and success in the box office. Both datasets were obtained from kaggle (movies from Daniel Grijalva and IMDb from PrompCloud). The IMDb dataset contains information from 2006-2016 for the 1,000 most popular movies and 12 variables including rank, title, genre, description, actors, year, runtime, votes, rating, revenue, and metascore.</description>

      <description>Nina Flores, nmf538 This data comes from a survey that Dr. Fatima Varner’s African American Resilience in Context lab in the Department of Human Development and Family Sciences conducted. The survey has responses from 324 black mothers and 252 black fathers with an adolescent child between 11-18. The survey had over 300 questions targeting various social constructs covering topics of school involvement, parenting behaviors, racial concerns, and racial discrimination. The variables of interest for this project include: ‘PA_EDU’, ‘PART_EDU’, ‘MARSTAT’, ‘TOTIVP’, ‘vicarious’, ‘pdisc’, ‘cdisc’, ‘TOTRCON’, ‘totbpi’, ‘NEIGHCOMP’, ‘JOBCOMP’, ‘SCHCOMP’, ‘TOTINC’, ‘recodedgpa’.</description>

      <description> Here are some projects I have been working on:
 Data Wrangling and Exploratory Analysis: An Exploratory Data Analysis on IMDb movie data for all the movie lovers like me.
  Modeling, Inference, Prediction: Statistical Modeling of K-12 school based marginialization targeting topics of child discrimination, problem behaviors, and demographics.
